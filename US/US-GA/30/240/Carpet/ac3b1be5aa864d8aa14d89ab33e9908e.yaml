  ## LCA Notes

  The LCA is for one square meter of flooring. While the warranted service life is
  15 years, modules B1, B3 ,B4, and B5 are not declared, so the maintenance (B4) is
  represented for one year. The system boundaries include: A1 Raw material extraction
  and processing, and processing of recycled materials A2 Transport to the factory
  A3 Manufacturing including materials, packaging, energy, and waste disposal or recycling
  A4 Transport to installation sites (Asia, US, and Europe) A5 Installation including
  ancillary materials required for installation and trim-waste disposal B2 Maintenance:
  Includes the energy for vacuuming, extraction cleaning and the production and transport
  of cleaning agents. The treatment of the waste-water from extraction cleaning is
  included. This is for one year of use. C2 Transport of waste to local disposal C4
  Disposal 2.3. Estimates and Assumptions The datasets for materials upstream from
  manufacturing are a combination of information from the GaBi database and supplier
  provided datasets. Inventories for all materials are not available and when unavailable,
  conservative proxy datasets were chosen based on similarity of material. 2.4. Cut-off
  Criteria As dictated by the Part A: Calculation rules for the life cycle assessment
  and requirements, the cut-off criteria is less than 1% for energy use and less than
  1% of total mass per unit process, the sum of which shall not exceed 5% of either
  energy or mass. If a flow met the cut-off criteria for exclusion, yet was thought
  to have significant environmental impact, then it was included. 2.5. Data Sources
  and Quality The datasets for materials upstream from manufacturing are a combination
  of information from the GaBi database version 9.2.68 in 2020 and supplier provided
  datasets. The data quality ranges from good to very good. The temporal quality of
  the data is very good with both the manufacturing specific data and the GaBi background
  data being from 2020. 2.6. Period under Review The data collection and the product
  described are an average product manufactured in 2020. 2.7. Allocation Where relevant,
  the background data incorporates some allocation such as in the power mix. There
  are no co-products produced in the process, so the LCA model does not include allocation.
  No credits were taken for recycling of |7| CQUESTTMBioX According to ISO 14025,

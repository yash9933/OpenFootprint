description: "Products covered in this Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) are\
  \ a broad variety of carpet styles and colors manufactured by Mannington Commercial,\
  \ backed with our rEvolve\xAE II modular backing system and made with either nylon\
  \ 6,6 or nylon 6 yarn. The fiber in these products (product wear layer) is constructed\
  \ using nylon 6,6 or nylon 6 yarn that is either solution dyed, yarn dyed, space\
  \ dyed, or a combination of these methods. rEvolve\xAE modular is a thermoplastic\
  \ polyolefin backing that is engineered for strong performance, excellent tuft bind,\
  \ and dimensional stability. rEvolve\xAE II modular is available in various modular\
  \ sizes, making installation and replacement simple. Like most Mannington Commercial\
  \ backing systems, these products are certified as environmentally preferable products\
  \ to NSF/ANSI 140:2015 Sustainability Assessment for Carpet, to the Gold level,\
  \ and manufactured in the USA in an ISO 14001 registered facility."

  \ of hexamethylene diamine and adipic acid. (Nylon 6-6, 2007) Nylon 6, CAS# 25038-54-4,\
  \ is synthesized by ring opening polymerization of caprolactam. Caprolactam is comprised\
  \ of six carbons creating the six in Nylon 6. (Nylon 6, 2005) Polyester (PET), CAS#\
  \ 25038-59-9, is a synthetic polymer made of purified terephthalic acid (PTA). (Polyester,\
  \ 2002) Vinyl Acetate/Ethylene copolymer, CAS# 24939-78-8, is prepared by polymerization\
  \ of vinyl acetate monomer and ethylene. Calcium carbonate, CAS# 1317-65-3, is an\
  \ abundant mineral found worldwide and is the chief substance found in rocks (i.e.,\
  \ marble and limestone). This material can be ground into varying particle sizes\
  \ and is widely used as filler material in formulated flooring systems. Polyethylene\
  \ polymer (PE), CAS# 25103-74-6, is prepared by either polymerizing ethylene through\
  \ coordination polymerization which uses a catalyst or through radical polymerization\
  \ which requires a high-pressure apparatus. (Polyethylene, 2002). Glass, CAS# 65997-17-3,\

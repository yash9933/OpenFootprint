description: "EF Contract\u2019s collection of easy to install luxury vinyl tile flooring\
  \ products along with our other flooring products, gives us a complete flooring\
  \ solution to offer our customers. Our high performance LVT products have commercial\
  \ grade backing and can withstand heavy amounts of traffic. These products are phthalate\
  \ free with recycled raw material and produced by using green energy in efficient\
  \ manufacturing environments that can boast 100% recycling capability. Products\
  \ are available in plank and tile format and the customer can choose from styles\
  \ that mimic natural wood, concrete and stone finishes. Durability is assured with\
  \ a UV cured urethane finish. The composition within the LVT family of products\
  \ does not differ other than pigments used to give each style of LVT its own distinct\
  \ appearance. This variation is less than 5% of the total product weight and is\
  \ excluded from the study."

manufacturing_description: "PRODUCTION OF MAIN MATERIALS:\n\nCalcium Carbonate: An\
  \ abundant mineral found worldwide and a common substance found in rocks. It can\
  \ be ground into varying particle sizes and used as inert filler.\n\nGlass Paper\
  \ (Fiber): Nonwoven glass scrim comprised of chopped glass and cellulose fibers\
  \ and binder.  Its major ingredients are silica sand, limestone, soda ash, and petrochemicals.\n\
  \nPolyvinyl Chloride (PVC): Derived from fossil fuel and salt. Petroleum or natural\
  \ gas is processed to make ethylene, and salt is subjected to electrolysis to separate\
  \ out the natural element chlorine. Ethylene and chlorine are combined to produce\
  \ ethylene dichloride, which is further processed into a gas called vinyl chloride\
  \ monomer (VCM). Polymerization of VCM molecules form chains, converting the gas\
  \ into fine, white powder\u2014vinyl resin. \n\nPlasticizer: Plasticizers are used\
  \ to make vinyl soft and flexible. Diisononyl phthalate (DINP) was used in the life\
  \ cycle assessment model to represent plasticizers used to manufacture products\
  \ covered by this EPD such as Diisooctyl terephthalate (DOTP).\n\nStabilizers: Stabilizers\
  \ (typically metal compounds) are used to prevent the chain reaction of decomposition\
  \ which occurs as PVC is heated to soften during the extrusion or molding process.\
  \ Stabilizers also provide enhanced resistance to daylight, weathering and heat\
  \ aging and have an important influence on the physical properties of PVC. The main\
  \ constituents are metal soaps, metal salts and organometallic compounds. The major\
  \ metals contained in stabilizers include lead (Pb), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca),\
  \ and tin (Sn) and are classified into Pb stabilizers, Ba-Znstabilizers, Ca-Zn stabilizers,\
  \ and Sn stabilizersPigment: A compounded mixture of pigment (e.g., carbon black,\
  \ titanium dioxide) and a polymer carrier used as a colorant.\n\nUV Resin (coating):\
  \ A UV coating composed of photo-curable oligomer, photo initiator, reactive acrylic\
  \ monomer and additives."

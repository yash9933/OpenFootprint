description: "J+J Flooring Group\u2019s collection of Nexus modular carpets work beautifully,\
  \ whether specified alone or with one of our many broadloom options. The two fiber\
  \ options for Nexus backing are Nylon 6 and PET. This EPD includes results for both\
  \ options of fibers. Nexus-backed carpet tiles are nylon 6 (or PET) fibers tufted\
  \ onto PVC backing. A representative product within the Nexus family was chosen.\
  \ The composition within the Nexus family of products does not differ other than\
  \ pigments and dyes used to give each style of carpet tile its own distinct appearance.\
  \ The variation in terms of pigments and dyes used is less than 5% of the total\
  \ product weight and is excluded from the study. This EPD covers all styles and\
  \ colors under the Nexus product family. Specific products can be found on J+J\u2019\
  s website. Each pattern, combined with our Nexus modular backing, continues our\
  \ over 55-year tradition for high performance and appealing design. Pair your imagination\
  \ with our comprehensive product choices on your next project and create your own\
  \ dramatic statement."

manufacturing_description: The manufacturing process starts with the fiber production.
  This includes taking virgin and recycled content nylon (or PET) granulate feedstock
  and extrude fibers. This is combined in a fiber blend process to create a typical
  fiber. These individual fibers then go through the processes of heat setting, air
  entangling and twisting to create yarn which is then tufted to a primary backing.
  The primary backing materials differs based on the type of backing being produced.
  The next step is coating which affixes secondary thermoset (latex) backing to tufted
  fiber and primary backing. Then, the manufactured secondary thermoplastic backing
  (PVC and PE) is affixed to the tufted fiber and backing. Finally, dye is applied
  to the tufted fiber in both piece (Beck and Skein) and space (Belmont) dye methods.
  The last step is cutting and packaging for shipment. This product contains no regulated
  substances above the required threshold.

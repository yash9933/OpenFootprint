description: "The problems that can arise when carpet is exposed to moisture are well\
  \ documented: mold and mildew, odor, product deterioration and total installation\
  \ failure. However, specifying and installing the right backing, such as J+J Flooring\
  \ Group\u2019s TitanBac Plus, can effectively prevent typical moisture problems\
  \ by acting as a moisture barrier to the underlying floor. TitanBac Plus also improves\
  \ carpet performance by allowing it to be more vigorously cleaned to retain its\
  \ aesthetic appeal for a longer period of time. TitanBac Plus has a nylon 6 face\
  \ fiber attached to a latex and polypropylene backing. A representative product\
  \ within the TitanBac Plus family was chosen. The composition within the TitanBac\
  \ Plus family of products does not differ other than pigments and dyes used to give\
  \ each style of broadloom carpet its own distinct appearance. The variation in terms\
  \ of pigments and dyes used is less than 5% of the total product weight and is excluded\
  \ from the study. This EPD covers all styles and colors under the TitanBac Plus\
  \ product family. Specific products can be found on J+J\u2019s website."

manufacturing_description: The manufacturing process starts with the fiber production.
  This includes taking virgin and recycled content nylon granulate feedstock and extrude
  fibers. This is combined in a fiber blend process to create a typical fiber. These
  individual fibers then go through the processes of heat setting, air entangling
  and twisting to create yarn which is then tufted to a primary backing. The primary
  backing materials differs based on the type of backing being produced. The next
  step is coating which affixes secondary thermoset (latex) backing to tufted fiber
  and primary backing. Then, the manufactured secondary thermoplastic backing (PVC
  and PE) is affixed to the tufted fiber and backing. Finally, dye is applied to the
  tufted fiber in both piece (Beck and Skein) and space (Belmont) dye methods. The
  last step is packaging for shipment. This product contains no regulated substances
  above the required threshold.

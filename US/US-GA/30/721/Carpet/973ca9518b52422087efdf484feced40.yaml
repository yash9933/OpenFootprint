manufacturing_description: "The first step in Kinetex manufacturing is needle-punching.\
  \ The process involves combining three different PET fibers into a felt product.\
  \ The fibers are combined by teasing them together with a series of needles. The\
  \ felt which forms a part of the secondary backing contains recycled content and\
  \ this has been incorporated into the LCA model. Needle punching is followed by\
  \ mechanicalbonding where PET yarn is affixed to a PET film. This process is similar\
  \ to tufting which is used in traditional carpet manufacturing. No glues or other\
  \ additives are utilized. Next, the mechanicallybonded intermediary from the previous\
  \ step undergoes bulking. This process involves adding heat and steam to the intermediary\
  \ to add volume to the fibers on the mechanicallybonded product. This is then sent\
  \ for laminating and embossing. The laminating process involves adding heat to the\
  \ intermediary created in the bulking stage and the felt product. This process involves\
  \ heating the two intermediaries to a level in which they \u201Cmelt\u201D together.\
  \ The process creates a permanent bind between the two layers. Embossing refers\
  \ to the stamping of a pattern on the face of the product. No additional material\
  \ inputs are necessary in this step. Finally, the tile cutting process involves\
  \ stamping out individual carpet tiles from the carpet roll completed in the laminating\
  \ phase. This is followed by packing the Textile Composite Flooring tiles for storage\
  \ or immediate shipment. This product contains no regulated substances above the\
  \ required threshold"

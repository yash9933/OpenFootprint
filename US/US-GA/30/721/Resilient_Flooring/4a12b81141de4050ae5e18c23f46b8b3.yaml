description: "J+J Flooring Group\u2019s collection of easy to install luxury vinyl\
  \ tile flooring products along with our other flooring products, gives us a complete\
  \ flooring solution to offer our customers. Our high performance LVT products have\
  \ commercial grade backing and can withstand heavy amounts of traffic. These products\
  \ are phthalate free with recycled raw material and produced by using green energy\
  \ in efficient manufacturing environments that can boast 100% recycling capability.\
  \ Products are available in plank and tile format and the customer can choose from\
  \ styles that mimic natural wood, concrete and stone finishes. Durability is assured\
  \ with a UV cured urethane finish.\n\nThis EPD covers all styles and colors under\
  \ J+J Flooring Group's LVT product family. Specific products can be found on J+J\
  \ Flooring Group\u2019s website. This includes products with specifications of the\
  \ following wear layers and thicknesses respectively; 2.5 mm/12 mil, 2.5 mm/20 mil,\
  \ 3mm/20 mil, 5 mm/20 mil.\n\nThe composition within the LVT family of products\
  \ does not differ other than pigments used to give each style of LVT its own distinct\
  \ appearance. This variation is less than 5% of the total product weight and is\
  \ excluded from the study."

manufacturing_description: "PRODUCTION OF MAIN MATERIALS:\n\nCalcium Carbonate: An\
  \ abundant mineral found worldwide and a common substance found in rocks. It can\
  \ be ground into varying particle sizes and used as an inert filler.\n\nGlass Paper\
  \ (Fiber): Nonwoven glass scrim comprised of chopped glass and cellulose fibers\
  \ and binder.  Its major ingredients are silica sand, limestone, soda ash, and petrochemicals.\n\
  \nPolyvinyl Chloride (PVC): Derived from fossil fuel and salt. Petroleum or natural\
  \ gas is processed to make ethylene, and salt is subjected to electrolysis to separate\
  \ out the natural element chlorine. Ethylene and chlorine are combined to produce\
  \ ethylene dichloride, which is further processed into a gas called vinyl chloride\
  \ monomer (VCM). Polymerization of VCM molecules form chains, converting the gas\
  \ into fine, white powder\u2014vinyl resin. \n\nPlasticizer: Plasticizers are used\
  \ to make vinyl soft and flexible. Diisononyl phthalate (DINP) wasused in the life\
  \ cycle assessment model to represent plasticizers used to manufacture products\
  \ covered by this EPD such as Diisooctyl terephthalate (DOTP).\n\nStabilizers: Stabilizers\
  \ (typically metal compounds) are used to prevent the chain reaction of decomposition\
  \ which occurs as PVC is heated to soften during the extrusion or molding process.\
  \ Stabilizers also provide enhanced resistance to daylight, weathering and heat\
  \ aging and have an important influence on the physical properties of PVC. The main\
  \ constituents are metal soaps, metal salts and organometallic compounds. The major\
  \ metals contained in stabilizers include lead (Pb), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca),\
  \ and tin (Sn) and are classified into Pb stabilizers, Ba-Zn stabilizers, Ca-Zn\
  \ stabilizers, and Sn stabilizers.\n\nPigment: A compounded mixture of pigment (e.g.,\
  \ carbon black, titanium dioxide) and a polymer carrier used as a colorant.\n\n\
  UV Resin (coating): A UV coating composed of photo-curable oligomer, photo initiator,\
  \ reactive acrylic monomer and additives."

description: "FOAMULAR\xAE NGX\u2122 XPS Insulation is a comprehensive line of rigid\
  \ foam products that are easy to use, resist water absorption, deliver high compressive\
  \ strength and maintain a high R-value throughout the life of the building.* It\
  \ has third-party certified recycled content - certified by SCS Global Services\
  \ - and, in addition is GREENGUARD Gold certified, offers the the industry\u2019\
  s only lifetime limited warranty.* FOAMULAR\xAE NGX\u2122 XPS Insulation is made\
  \ with Owens Corning\u2019s patented Hydrovac\xAE process technology under strict\
  \ quality control measures, which makes it highly resistant to moisture and permits\
  \ the product to retain its high R-value year after year even after prolonged exposure\
  \ to moisture and freeze/thaw cycling. Another primary difference with FOAMULAR\xAE\
  \ NGX\u2122 XPS Insulation products is its compressive strength. FOAMULAR\xAE NGX\u2122\
  \ XPS Insulation has compressive strengths of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 60 and 100\
  \ psi. The variety of products provides different strengths for use in walls, where\
  \ there is almost no compressive load, or intermediate strength product for use\
  \ with modest loads such as around foundations, or in low slope roofs. It also is\
  \ suitable for use under high load pavement, such as floors or plaza decks. FOAMULAR\xAE\
  \ NGX\u2122 XPS Insulation is an integral component of our Owens Corning\xAE ResidentialComplete\xAE\
  \ Wall Systems and the Owens Corning\xAE CommercialComplete\xAE Wall Systems portfolios.\
  \ FOAMULAR\xAE NGX\u2122 contains the additional benefit of being manufactured with\
  \ a blowing agent formulation that delivers a 90% reduction to Global Warming Potential\
  \ (100 year) compared to FOAMULAR\xAE blowing agent, including the complete elimination\
  \ of HFC 134a."

lca_discussion: "\n\n## Product Component Notes\nFOAMULAR\xAE NGX\u2122 XPS Insulation\
  \ consists of two major components, polystyrene resin and a blend of HFC and HFO\
  \ blowing agents. Although the majority of the polystyrene is virgin material, there\
  \ is an appreciable amount of pre-consumer, recycled polystyrene content. The remainder\
  \ of the material is composed of performance additives, a brominated polymeric flame\
  \ retardant, and colorant. Each of these minor components is less than 1% by mass\
  \ of the total material composition. Material Component Material Component% -------------------------------------\

  \ was collected from the locations listed in the Manufacturing section. Life-cycle\
  \ modeling and calculation of potential environmental impacts were conducted using\
  \ the LCA software SimaPro 9, version 9.0.0.35, developed by PR\xE9 Consultants\
  \ bv. For the HFO portion of the blowing agent, LCI data from the manufacturer was\
  \ used. The LCI database used for remaining secondary data was the ecoinvent 3.5\
  \ database, provided with the Developer version of the software. In situations where\
  \ LCI databases did not contain life-cycle inventory data for certain specific materials\
  \ or processes used in either the manufacturing of precursor, input raw materials\
  \ or the manufacturing of the XPS insulation itself, LCI data for a similar material\
  \ or process was used as a substitute. In order to determine the most representative\
  \ substitute, preliminary analyses were conducted."

  \ a \u201Ccradle-to-grave\u201D LCA analysis for wet-formed mineral fiber ceiling\
  \ panels. It covers all the production steps from raw material extraction (i.e.,\
  \ the cradle) to end of life disposal (grave). 2.3. Estimates and Assumptions In\
  \ the case of the wet-formed mineral fiber ceiling panel production at the Cloquet,\
  \ MN plant, data collection of energy and raw material inputs were aided by the\
  \ presence of an extensive computer monitoring system which tracked product formulas\
  \ by product type. All wet-formed mineral fiber ceiling product raw material and\
  \ energy inputs are specific to the specific wet-formed mineral fiber product produced\
  \ at the Cloquet, MN plant. Additional data limitations include the use of proxy\
  \ processes rather than actual supplier generated primary data. This would include\
  \ such processes as starch, which is representative of wet-milled corn starch but\
  \ may not necessarily be representative of USG\u2019s particular starch supplier.\
  \ In addition, the data is limited in that the primary data was collected during\
  \ the 2017 year and changes in operations may increase/decrease impacts in the future.\
  \ Other data limitations include the use of secondary data sets instead of primary\
  \ data for upstream and downstream processes, local impacts vs. global impacts,\
  \ possible impacts vs. actual impacts, inherent uncertainty in the data sets, accuracy\
  \ and precision of impact assessment methodology, etc. 2.4. Cut-off Criteria All\
  \ inputs and outputs to a (unit) process were included in the calculation for which\
  \ data is available. In case of insufficient input data or data gaps for a unit\
  \ process, the cut-off criteria was 1% of renewable and non- renewable primary energy\
  \ usage and 1% of the total mass of that unit process. The total neglected input\
  \ flows did not exceed 5% of energy usage and mass. |6| Orion\u2122 60, Orion\u2122\
  \ 75 and Orion\u2122 85 Acoustical Ceiling Panels with ClimaPlus\u2122 Performance\
  \ According to ISO 14025, ISO 21930:2007 As such, some minor additives fell well\
  \ below the cut-off criteria and were therefore not included in this study. 2.5.\
  \ Background Data All background was sourced from critically reviewed GaBi databases.\
  \ 2.6. Data Quality The LCA model was created using the GaBi ts software. Specific\
  \ comments related to data quality requirements cited in ISO 14025 Section 4.2.3.6.2\
  \ include the following. Temporal: In the case of wet-formed mineral fiber ceiling\
  \ tile production, the LCI data was collected from the Cloquet, MN plant for the\
  \ 2017 production year. Geographical: Where possible, all processes were chosen\
  \ as being representative of US manufacturing processes. Technical: The data selected\
  \ for this study is specific to the technology used in the preparation of the various\
  \ raw materials. Precision: The raw material usage amounts were derived from plant\
  \ quality data on finished products, coatings usage plant data and product formulas.\
  \ Completeness: Virtually all the significant raw material flows (> 99%) in wet-formed\
  \ mineral fiber ceiling panel production has been modeled. The exception consists\
  \ of transportation of the coating raw materials; the effect of which was determined\
  \ to be less than 1% of the total. Representative: Where possible all the data sets\
  \ were selected to be representative of US-based production, are less than 10 years\
  \ in age and are representative of the technology being employed. Consistency: All\
  \ the manufacturing processes were modeled in a consistent manner throughout this\
  \ study in accordance with the goal and scope definitions. Reproducibility: The\
  \ information contained in this study, including raw material, energy and transportation\
  \ distance inputs, have been fully documented in the LCA report. Sources of Data:\
  \ The sources for the processes used in this study have been fully provided in the\
  \ LCA report and are representative of the material and energy sources used in actual\
  \ production. Uncertainty: The relative uncertainty associated with this study has\
  \ been minimized. No significant assump\n\n## Source Data Notes\nLCA Report LCA\

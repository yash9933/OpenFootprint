  \ Product Formulation Additive Gypsum Paper Additives Percentage 92% 7% 1% 1.6 Product\
  \ Manufacture The manufacture of gypsum board starts with the combining of the dry\
  \ ingredients in a screw conveyor, feeding of this dry ingredient mixture into a\
  \ pin mixer where these dry ingredients are mixed with water and wet additives.\
  \ The resulting slurry is fed between two sheets of paper; facing paper (Manila)\
  \ on the bottom and backing paper (Newsline) on the top. The wet gypsum board is\
  \ allowed to hydrate after which the hard board is cut and transferred into a kiln\
  \ for evaporation of excess water. After removal of the evaporative water, the board\
  \ is cut to its final size, end tapes are applied and the resulting product is ready\
  \ for shipment. Any gypsum board not meeting quality control specifications is recycled\
  \ on-site. Figure 1: Process diagram for the production of gypsum board Page 4 of\
  \ 12 1.7 Environment and Health During Manufacturing USG and CGC have led the building\
  \ sector\u2019s effort in developing and supplying sustainable construction materials.\
  \ Today, sustainability is integrated into the design and manufacture of every wall,\
  \ ceiling, and flooring product. As both a producer and a buyer of raw materials,\
  \ we have a responsibility to extensively review and select each material we use.\
  \ Each decision we make is based on careful consideration of environmental and safety\
  \ effects over time. Raw materials used in our products are carefully selected and\
  \ go through a screening procedure. Incoming raw materials are tested for contaminants\
  \ by an internal lab and third-party labs for consideration of use and worker, environmental,\
  \ and end-user exposure. This due diligence helps to ensure our products are safe\
  \ to handle in our manufacturing plants and on job sites while having minimal impact\
  \ on occupant health and indoor and outdoor environments. 1.8 Packaging End tape\
  \ is applied to every two pieces to form a unit for shipment. A quantity of units\
  \ is collected and placed on sleutters (i.e., spacers) for easy pick-up by fork\
  \ lift trucks. 1.9 Distribution The default distances from the PCR for both truck\
  \ 280 miles (451 km) and rail 130 miles (209 km) transport were used in this analysis.\
  \ Final transportation from the distribution gate to the construction site was defaulted\
  \ to 25 miles (40 km) by a single unit truck with an empty backhaul. 1.10 Product\
  \ Installation For installation of gypsum panel products, refer to Gypsum Association's\
  \ GA-216, Application and Finishing of Gypsum Panel Products, ASTM C840, Standard\
  \ Specification for Application and Finishing of Gypsum Board, published UL Design\
  \ or GA File Number and USG Gypsum Construction Handbook. As dictated by the PCR,\
  \ \u201Cthe default on-site installation waste\u201D scenario for gypsum boards\
  \ was 10% on a surface area basis of gypsum board product. A 10% installation waste\
  \ factor was adhered to in this LCA analysis. Installation of the gypsum board into\
  \ the building includes the manufacture and transportation of ancillary inputs and\
  \ any energy or water required for installation or operation of the construction\
  \ site. The installation stage included provision of all materials (joint tape,\
  \ joint treatment, and fasteners) and energy required to install the product per\
  \ industry standards. The amounts of joint tape, joint compound and fasteners required\
  \ for installing 1,000 square feet (1 MSF) of gypsum board was based on industry\
  \ standards. In the case of Joint compound, the amount was based on the PCR for\
  \ joint compound. Energy required during installation of this product is predominantly\
  \ manual labor with minimal electricity which has been omitted in this analysis.\
  \ 1.11 Environment and Health During Use Stage Under normal conditions of intended\
  \ use, this material does not pose a risk to the environment or occupant health.\
  \ 1.12 Reference Service Life A default RSL of 75 years shall be assumed for the\
  \ product. An assumed Estimated Service Life (ESL) of 75 years shall be used for\
  \ building life. Page 5 of 12 1.13 End-of-Life Currently, gypsum board is typically\
  \ disposed of in a building and construction landfill. In certain areas, USG has\
  \ agreements with third-party gypsum waste recyclers who collect gypsum construction\
  \ waste at jobsites for recycling and then transport this post-consumer gypsum raw\
  \ material to specific USG and CGC manufacturing plants for use in the manufacturing\
  \ of new wallboard. There are several alternative options to landfilling such as\
  \ the use of reground gypsum wallboard for soil amendment applications. Contact\
  \ your local EPA for reuses rules and regulations. 1.14 Documentation on Additional\
  \ Environmental Information 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) Sheetrock\xAE Brand UltraLight Panels\
  \ have achieved GREENGUARD Gold Certification and qualifies as a \u201CLow Emitting\u201D\
  \ material per California Department of Public Health CDPH/EHLB/Standard Method\
  \ (CA Section 01350) for school classroom, and private office modeling scenarios,\
  \ and meets USGBC\u2019s LEED\xAE v4 emission requirements. 2. LCA Calculation Rules\
  \ 2.1 Functional Unit The functional unit for this LCA study is 1,000 sf (92.9 m2)\
  \ of product. This functional unit is consistent with the PCR. Table 1: Functional\
  \ unit Gypsum Board Functional Unit Declared Density Declared Density Value and\
  \ Units 1,000 sf (92.9 m2) 1330 lbs./MSF 6.5 kg/m2 2.2 System Boundary This cradle-to-grave\
  \ (A1-C4) LCA study covers all the production steps from raw materials extracted\
  \ from the earth (the cradle) to pallets of taped gypsum board ready to be shipped\
  \ from the plant as well as distribution, installation (including contributions\
  \ from fasteners, joint tape, and joint compound), use and end of life stages (the\
  \ grave). This study also includes the preparation of an intermediate LCA on joint\
  \ compound used in the installation of this product. Page 6 of 12 Figure 2: Specific\
  \ processes covered by this EPD by life cycle stage 2.3 Estimates and Assumptions\
  \ All paper raw material and energy data is specific to the manufacture of USG Manila\
  \ and Newsline papers at the specific USG paper mill. 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) Sheetrock\xAE\
  \ Brand UltraLight Panels raw material and energy inputs are specific to the specific\
  \ products produced at the gypsum board plant. 2.4 Cut-off Criteria The cut-off\
  \ criteria for input flows to be considered within each system boundary were as\
  \ follows: Mass - if a flow is less than 1% of the cumulative mass of the model\
  \ flows it may be excluded, providing its environmental relevance is minor. Energy\
  \ - if a flow is less than 1% of the cumulative energy of the system model it may\
  \ be excluded, providing its environmental relevance is minor. The sum of the excluded\
  \ material flows must not exceed 5% of mass, energy or environmental relevance.\
  \ 2.5 Background Data All background was sourced from critically reviewed GaBi databases.\
  \ 2.6 Data Requirements and Data Sources Manufacturer specific data was obtained\
  \ from each United States gypsum board manufacturing plant. The LCA model was created\
  \ using the GaBi ts software. Specific comments related to data quality requi"

  \ (8.8 kg/sq.m.) Tapered Product Formulation Additive Gypsum Paper Additives Percentage\
  \ 90% 6% 4% 1.6 Product Manufacture The manufacture of gypsum board starts with\
  \ the combining of the dry ingredients in a screw conveyor, feeding of this dry\
  \ ingredient mixture into a pin mixer where these dry ingredients are mixed with\
  \ water and wet additives. The resulting slurry is fed between two sheets of paper;\
  \ facing paper (Manila) on the bottom and backing paper (Newsline) on the top. The\
  \ wet gypsum board is allowed to hydrate after which the hard board is cut and transferred\
  \ into a kiln for evaporation of excess water. After removal of the evaporative\
  \ water, the board is cut to its final size, end tapes are applied and the resulting\
  \ product is ready for shipment. Any gypsum board not meeting quality control specifications\
  \ is recycled on-site. Figure 1: Process diagram for the production of gypsum board\
  \ Page 4 of 12 1.7 Environment and Health During Manufacturing USG and CGC have\
  \ led the building sector\u2019s effort in developing and supplying sustainable\
  \ construction materials. Today, sustainability is integrated into the design and\
  \ manufacture of every wall, ceiling, and flooring product. As both a producer and\
  \ a buyer of raw materials, we have a responsibility to extensively review and select\
  \ each material we use. Each decision we make is based on careful consideration\
  \ of environmental and safety effects over time. Raw materials used in our products\
  \ are carefully selected and go through a screening procedure. Incoming raw materials\
  \ are tested for contaminants by an internal lab and third-party labs for consideration\
  \ of use and worker, environmental, and end-user exposure. This due diligence helps\
  \ to ensure our products are safe to handle in our manufacturing plants and on job\
  \ sites while having minimal impact on occupant health and indoor and outdoor environments.\
  \ 1.8 Packaging End tape is applied to every two pieces to form a unit for shipment.\
  \ A quantity of units is collected and placed on sleutters (i.e., spacers) for easy\
  \ pick-up by fork lift trucks. 1.9 Distribution The default distances from the PCR\
  \ for both truck 280 miles (451 km) and rail 130 miles (209 km) transport were used\
  \ in this analysis. Final transportation from the distribution gate to the construction\
  \ site was defaulted to 25 miles (40 km) by a single unit truck with an empty backhaul.\
  \ 1.10 Product Installation For installation of gypsum panel products, refer to\
  \ Gypsum Association's GA-216, Application and Finishing of Gypsum Panel Products,\
  \ ASTM C840, Standard Specification for Application and Finishing of Gypsum Board,\
  \ published UL Design or GA File Number and USG Gypsum Construction Handbook. As\
  \ dictated by the PCR, \u201Cthe default on-site installation waste\u201D scenario\
  \ for gypsum boards was 10% on a surface area basis of gypsum board product. A 10%\
  \ installation waste factor was adhered to in this LCA analysis. Installation of\
  \ the gypsum board into the building includes the manufacture and transportation\
  \ of ancillary inputs and any energy or water required for installation or operation\
  \ of the construction site. The installation stage included provision of all materials\
  \ (joint tape, joint treatment, and fasteners) and energy required to install the\
  \ product per industry standards. The amounts of joint tape, joint compound and\
  \ fasteners required for installing 1,000 square feet (1 MSF) of gypsum board was\
  \ based on industry standards. In the case of Joint compound, the amount was based\
  \ on the PCR for joint compound. Energy required during installation of this product\
  \ is predominantly manual labor with minimal electricity which has been omitted\
  \ in this analysis. 1.11 Environment and Health During Use Stage Under normal conditions\
  \ of intended use, this material does not pose a risk to the environment or occupant\
  \ health. 1.12 Reference Service Life A default RSL of 75 years shall be assumed\
  \ for the product. An assumed Estimated Service Life (ESL) of 75 years shall be\
  \ used for building life. Page 5 of 12 1.13 End-of-Life Currently, gypsum board\
  \ is typically disposed of in a building and construction landfill. In certain areas,\
  \ USG has agreements with third-party gypsum waste recyclers who collect gypsum\
  \ construction waste at jobsites for recycling and then transport this post-consumer\
  \ gypsum raw material to specific USG manufacturing plants for use in the manufacturing\
  \ of new wallboard. There are several alternative options to landfilling such as\
  \ the use of reground gypsum wallboard for soil amendment applications. Contact\
  \ your local EPA for reuses rules and regulations. 1.14 Documentation on Additional\
  \ Environmental Information 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) Sheetrock\xAE Brand EcoSmart Panels\
  \ Firecode\xAE X have achieved GREENGUARD Gold Certification and qualifies as a\
  \ \u201CLow Emitting\u201D material per California Department of Public Health CDPH/EHLB/Standard\
  \ Method (CA Section 01350) for school classroom, and private office modeling scenarios,\
  \ and meets USGBC\u2019s LEED\xAE v4 emission requirements. 2. LCA Calculation Rules\
  \ 2.1 Functional Unit The functional unit for this LCA study is 1,000 sf (92.9 m2)\
  \ of product. This functional unit is consistent with the PCR. Table 3: Functional\
  \ unit Gypsum Board Functional Unit Declared Density Declared Density Value and\
  \ Units 1,000 sf (92.9 m2) 1840 lbs./MSF 9.0 kg/m2 2.2 System Boundary This cradle-to-grave\
  \ (A1-C4) LCA study covers all the production steps from raw materials extracted\
  \ from the earth (the cradle) to pallets of taped gypsum board ready to be shipped\
  \ from the plant as well as distribution, installation (including contributions\
  \ from fasteners, joint tape, and joint compound), use and end of life stages (the\
  \ grave). This study also includes the preparation of an intermediate LCA on joint\
  \ compound used in the installation of this product. Page 6 of 12 Figure 2: Specific\
  \ processes covered by this EPD by life cycle stage 2.3 Estimates and Assumptions\
  \ All paper raw material and energy data is specific to the manufacture of USG Manila\
  \ and Newsline papers at the specific USG paper mill. 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) Sheetrock\xAE\
  \ Brand EcoSmart Panels Firecode\xAE X raw material and energy inputs are specific\
  \ to the specific products produced at the gypsum board plant. 2.4 Cut-off Criteria\
  \ The cut-off criteria for input flows to be considered within each system boundary\
  \ were as follows: Mass - if a flow is less than 1% of the cumulative mass of the\
  \ model flows it may be excluded, providing its environmental relevance is minor.\
  \ Energy - if a flow is less than 1% of the cumulative energy of the system model\
  \ it may be excluded, providing its environmental relevance is minor. The sum of\
  \ the excluded mater"

  \ in Medford, OR is an engineered panel, manufactured to specific standards as described\
  \ in the ANSI A208.2 MDF standard. Physical and mechanical properties of panels\
  \ are tested in accordance with ASTM D 1037, \u201CStandard Test Methods for Evaluating\
  \ the Properties of Wood-Based Fiber and Particle Panel Materials.\u201D Specific\

  \ system boundary was used for the analysis. Within these boundaries the following\
  \ stages were included: - Product stage: modules A1 to A3 Each module includes provision\
  \ of all relevant materials, products and energy. Impacts and aspects related to\

  \ study\u2019s scope. Capital goods and infrastructure flows are assumed to not\
  \ significantly affect LCA results or conclusions and thus excluded from the analysis\
  \ according to the cut-off rules. 2.3. Allocation Allocation of manufacturing material\
  \ and energy inputs was done on a mass-basis. Allocation of transportation was based\
  \ on mass while taking into account the utilization rate. |4| MEDIUM DENSITY FIBERBOARD\
  \ According to ISO 14025, EN 15804 and ISO 21930:2017 2.4. Cut-off Rules The procedure\
  \ detailed in ISO 21930:2017 Section 7.1.8 must be followed for the exclusion of\
  \ any inputs or outputs. The PCR states: Criteria for the exclusion of inputs and\
  \ outputs (cut-off rules) in the Life Cycle Assessment and information modules and\
  \ any additional information are intended to support an efficient calculation procedure.\
  \ They shall not be applied in order to hide data. Any application of the criteria\
  \ for the exclusion of inputs and outputs shall be documented. No cut-off criteria\
  \ had to be applied for this study, as the system boundary was defined based on\
  \ relevance to the goal of the study. For the processes within the system boundary,\
  \ all available energy and material flow data have been included in the model. In\
  \ cases where no matching life cycle inventories are available to represent a flow,\
  \ proxy data have been applied based on conservative assumptions regarding environmental\
  \ impacts. 2.5. Data Sources The LCA model was created using the GaBi ts Software\
  \ system for life cycle engineering, developed by thinkstep AG (thinkstep, 2019).\
  \ Background life cycle inventory data for raw materials and processes were obtained\
  \ from the GaBi 2019 database (service pack 38). Primary manufacturing data were\
  \ provided by Roseburg. 2.6. Data Quality A variety of tests and checks were performed\
  \ throughout the project to ensure high quality of the completed LCA. Checks included\
  \ a review of project-specific LCA models as well as the background data used. Geographical\
  \ Coverage In order to satisfy cut-off criteria, proxy datasets were used as needed\
  \ for raw material inputs to address lack of data for a specific material or for\
  \ a specific geographical region. These proxy datasets were chosen for their representativeness\
  \ of the actual product. Additionally, European data or global data were used when\
  \ North American data (for raw materials sourced in the US) were not available.\
  \ Temporal Coverage Foreground data is from 2018. The majority of background datasets\
  \ are based on data from the last 3 years (since 2016). Technological Coverage The\
  \ primary data represent production of the product under evaluation. Secondary data\
  \ were chosen to be specific to the technologies in question (or appropriate proxy\
  \ data used where necessary). Completeness Foreground processes were checked for\
  \ mass balance and completeness of the emissions inventory. No data were knowingly\
  \ omitted. 2.7. Period under Review This analysis is intended to represent production\
  \ in 2018. 2.8. Treatment of Biogenic Carbon Per the PCR and ISO 21930, the uptake\
  \ and emissions of carbon dioxide are separately reported for increased |5| MEDIUM\
  \ DENSITY FIBERBOARD According to ISO 14025, EN 15804 and ISO 21930:2017 transparency.\
  \ Global warming potential is reported excluding biogenic carbon. 2.9. Comparability\
  \ No comparisons or benchmarking is included in this EPD. LCA results across EPDs\
  \ can be calculated with different background databases, modeling assumptions, geographic\
  \ scope and time periods, all of which are valid and acceptable\n\n## Source Data\
  \ Notes\nThe LCA model was created using the GaBi ts Software system for life cycle\
  \ engineering, developed by thinkstep AG (thinkstep, 2019). Background life cycle\
  \ inventory data for raw materials and processes were obtained from the GaBi 2019\
  \ database (service pack 38). Primary manufacturing data were provided by Roseburg."
